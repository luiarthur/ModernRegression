%Setting %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%- 5pts Problem Statement and Understanding 
%    Does the report summaryciently describe the background of the problem?
%    Are the goals of the analysis clearly stated?
%
%- 15pts Describe the method/model(s) that are used.
%    Was a brief description of method/model used given in the report?
%    Were any greek letters used clearly defined?  
%    Were any explicit or implicit assumptions needed to use the model adequately 
%    explained? (Collinearity, Linearity, Independence)
%
%- 10pts Model Justification
%    Does the report give reasons for why the particular model was chosen?
%    Does the report describe why this model is appropriate for this data and how 
%    it solves the current problem?
%    Are the assumptions of the model justified (e.g. via exploratory analysis)?
%
%- 15pts Results
%    Does the report adequately answer the questions posed in the case study?
%    Were estimates of the parameters and their uncertainties given?
%    Were the parameters interpreted in the context of the problem?
%    Did the report summarize the main points of the results in non-statistical 
%    terms?
%
%- 5pts Conclusions
%
%    Did the report discuss other potential approaches to solving the problem?
%    Did the report discuss any shortcomings of the approach/model used?
%    Did the report provide suggestions for next steps in the analysis or further 
%    questions that may be of interest?
